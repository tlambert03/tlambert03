I'm a neurobiologist and microscopist by training, and I enjoy maintaining libraries in
the general ecosystem of python image visualization and analysis.

- I was a core developer of [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari).
- Many of the patterns I developed there have been extracted into
  reusable libraries in the [pyapp-kit organization](https://github.com/pyapp-kit)
  which I continue to maintain.
- I also maintain the [pymmcore-plus organization](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus), a set of packages
  for microscopy aquisition in pure-python/C++ environments.

In this github org, notable libraries include:
- [FPbase](https://github.com/tlambert03/fpbase): source code for [fpbase.org](https://fpbase.org), the fluorescent protein database.
- [nd2](https://github.com/tlambert03/nd2): modern nd2 (Nikon NIS-elements) file reader with broad support
- [ome-types](https://github.com/tlambert03/ome-types): Python classes for working with the [OME datamodel](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.0.1/) (i.e. OME-XML metadata)
- [pycudadecon](https://github.com/tlambert03/pycudadecon): Python wrapper for CUDA-accelerated 3D deconvolution for microscopy
- [pycudasirecon](https://github.com/tlambert03/pycudasirecon): CUDA-accelerated reconstruction for 3D-structured-illumination
- [cmap](https://github.com/tlambert03/cmap): Comprehensive colormap library, with only numpy dependency
- [PSFmodels](https://github.com/tlambert03/PSFmodels): Scalar and vectorial models of the 3D microscope point spread function.
- [mrc](https://github.com/tlambert03/mrc): deltavision (.mrc/.dv) image file format reader/writer.
